username = "username"
password = "password"
hostname = "hostname"

#Create an instance for your firewall
firewall=PaloAlto(username,password,hostname)

#Generate an API key for use in API calls
results = firewall.gen_api_key()

results = firewall.xml_api(TYPE, ACTION, XPATH, CONTENT)

#results['result'] contains true or false to indicate success, results['message'] to tell you what happened, and if it was successful, ['url'] has the URL used for the API request, ['text'] has the text of the response, and ['json'] has the JSON form of the response in dictionary format.

results = firewall.rest_api(PATH, DATA, METHOD)

#results['result'] contains true or false to indicate success, results['message'] to tell you what happened, and if it was successful, ['url'] has the URL used for the API request, ['text'] has the text of the response, and ['json'] has the JSON form of the response in dictionary format.
